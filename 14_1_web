What is an HTTP request?
A request your browser sends to the given IP address - includes a lot of "header" information such as browser language, cookies, etc. 
Also the method - GET, POST, etc.

What is an HTTP response?

What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
Can include the language your browser wants the response in, date your browser thinks it is, and any cookies.

What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
Computer checks browser cache, then local storage, then Internet Service Provider, then top-level domain name to try and resolve that URL into
an IP address where the server is located.
The server returns the content you want (or, more commonly, checks its own servers and assembles the content, then sends it back to you).
