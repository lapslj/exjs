What is the difference between var and let?
  VAR has a function scope and allows redeclaring; LET is block-scoped and doesn't allow re-declaring.
What is the difference between var and const?
  Same as first answer; CONST also doesn't allow changing.
What is the difference between let and const?
  LET can be changed (let x = 5; x = 6); CONST cannot be changed, though it can be mutated.
What is hoisting?
  When a variable is hoisted, its declaration is read before the code is initialized, meaning that if you call the variable 
  without assigning it a value, it will return "undefined". Variables that are -not- hoisted will return a Ref Error. 
  Variables declared with VAR are hoisted and variables declared with LET or CONST are not hoisted.

EXERCISES 10_3

A. function double(arr) {
  return arr.map(function(val) {
    return val * 2;
  });
}

ES2015 version:
let double = arr => arr.map(val => val*2);

B.
function squareAndFindEvens(numbers){
  var squares = numbers.map(function(num){
    return num ** 2;
  });
  var evens = squares.filter(function(square){
    return square % 2 === 0;
  });
  return evens;
}

squares => squares.map(val => val **2)

ES2015 version:
let squares = squares => squares.map(val => val **2)
let squareAndFindEvens = squares => squares.map(val => val **2).filter(square => square % 2 ===0)
